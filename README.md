# SudokuSolver

This project was originally meant as an AI learning project that would solve Sudoku puzzles.
After some research on how these puzzles are made it became clear that valid Sudoku puzzle generation also requires some programmed intelligence.
Thus this project now creates valid Sudokus that the user can solve.

This project features a simple GUI built with Java Swing that displays the Sudoku grid. Users can fill the grid by pressing a number button on the keyboard while hovering a cell with a mouse.
